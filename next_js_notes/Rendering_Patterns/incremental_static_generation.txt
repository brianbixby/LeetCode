INCREMENTAL STATIC GENERATION 
    -combination of static pre-rendered pages and dynamic pages, example: the blog article pages would be dynamically created and the about page would be pre-rendered and because of that While the generation of the page takes place, a fallback page or a loading indicator can be shown to the user on the front-end
        Once it is generated it will be cached

    in getStativ Props can have rrevalidate property and a time in seconds the page will refresh once that time is hit 
    
    BENEFITS ARE DYNAMIC DATA WITHOUT NEED TO REBUILD THE SITE, However server costs with all the reloads and revalidations
